## ✨ **System Platforms**

- **Admin Management Platform**  
  This platform is designed for office administrators. Administrators log in with **admin** or **superadmin** roles.  
  The **admin** role has management platform operation permissions, enabling access to dashboards, live streams, system configurations, etc.  
  The **superadmin** role has full permissions on the web platform, including operations for any workshop data collection, configuration, management, and viewing. This role should be assigned with caution.

- **MES Platform**  
  This platform is designed for workshop production supervisors and workers. Users log in with the **user** role. Each user needs to configure a **phaseTag** (a code for each workshop).  
  User registration must specify the **phaseTag**, and after login, users can only see and operate the management pages for their assigned workshop.
